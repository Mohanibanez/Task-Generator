<!--We have a CSS file, but our HTML documents still donâ€™t know how to link to it.
The idea is we should link each page to the CSS. So, open your base.html page and add a head section-->

<!-- An HTML document must start with a declaration that specifies the document type: <!DOCTYPE html>.-->
<!--The HTML document itself always begins with <html> and ends with </html>.-->
<!--The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.
<!--The area outside of that is used to reference Javascript files, CSS, or other features.-->
