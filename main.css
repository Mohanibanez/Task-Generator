/*We need to add some style formatting to the HTML structure using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
 That is done by creating a CSS file and connecting it to our HTML files.
 CSS is a style language that likewise HTML it is also very easy to learn.
 Remember that HTML template files HTML go inside the templates folder.
 CSS stylesheets are considered static files. There is no interaction with their code, like there is with HTML templates.
 Therefore, flask has reserved a separate folder where you should put static files such as CSS, Javascript, images or other files.
 That folder should be created by you and should be named static.
 Itâ€™s also good practice to create another folder inside static and name it css.
 What the code is basically doing is referring to the HTML tags and div class names and-
 -applying fonts, colors, text size, padding, margins and background colors to those HTML elements.
